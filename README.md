# ai-assignment
Project Description:

This is a Checkers bot implemented using the Minimax algorithm with advanced optimization techniques including:

Alpha-beta pruning

Iterative deepening

The bot was developed as part of an academic assignment, focusing on creating an efficient AI player for the game of Checkers.

Features:

Minimax algorithm implementation

Alpha-beta pruning for improved search efficiency

Iterative deepening search strategy

Time-constrained move selection (20 seconds per player)

Requirements:

Python 3.x

pip

Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

How It Works:

The bot uses a sophisticated AI approach:

Implements Minimax algorithm for game tree exploration

Uses alpha-beta pruning to reduce unnecessary search branches

Applies iterative deepening to maximize search depth within time constraints

Each player is allocated 20 seconds to make a move
